Linux Wireless compatibility package
=====================================

This is a Linux wireless compatibility package which provides the latest
Linux wireless subsystem enhancements for kernels 2.6.25 and above.
It is technically possible to support kernels < 2.6.25 but more
work is required for that.
It also provides Linux bluetooth subsystem enhancements for kernels 2.6.27 and above.

If you'd like to keep the wireless-testing git repository local as well,
please read out git-guide which explains how to achieve this:

http://wireless.kernel.org/en/developers/git-guide

With a local git repository you can update the compatibility package yourself. 
For more information on how to do this please refer the Developers section below.

Documentation
------------

This package is also documented online and has more-up-to date
information online than on this README file. You should read the wiki page
and not rely on this README:

http://wireless.kernel.org/en/users/Download

Subscribe to the wiki page to get updates on the documentation.

Where to get the latest
-----------------------

This package lets you build your own 'latest', all you need is a local git repository
checkout of wireless-testing.git. However since not many users are expected to keep
a local git repository of wireless-testing we provide daily snapshots of this
package + the wireless subsystem code. You can find the latest snapshot at:

http://wireless.kernel.org/en/users/Download

Selecting your driver
---------------------

If you know the driver you want you can select it with our
helper script:

./scripts/driver-select

Run that script to see more information.

Building, and installing
------------------------

Build: build the latest linux wireless subsystem

	make

Install:

We use the updates/ directory so your distribution's drivers are left intact.

	sudo make install

Uninstall:

This nukes our changes to updates/ so you can go back to using your
distribution's supported drivers.

	sudo make uninstall

Load:

Reboot unless you know what you are doing.


Bluetooth modules can be seperately compiled and installed using below commands

Build:
	make bt

Install:
	sudo make btinstall

Uninstall:
	sudo make btuninstall

Load:
	sudo make btload

Unload:
	sudo make btunload

Drivers

This package also provides more drivers which may be documented here

For a complete list see:

Non-wireless drivers
--------------------

To support b43 ssb is also provided, and since ssb is also provided
we provide b44 (the ethernet driverl).

The new rfkill drivers also provided and backported.

Bluetooth drivers:
bluetooth
btusb
hci_uart
btsdio
btuart_cs
bluecard_cs
bfusb

Firmware:
---------

If your driver needs firmware please be sure to check the driver page
for that driver here:

http://wireless.kernel.org/en/users/Drivers

Why?
----

For users or developers stuck on older kernels that want to help test or 
patch wireless work. Additionally if you're on a recent kernel this lets
you get the latest and greatest wireless-testing git work without much effort.
This may mean new drivers for some users. Last but not least we hope this
will encourage vendors and developers to post patches upstream first
rather than forking or maintaining their own mac80211 releases with
their own patches for their own drivers.

Building for external kernels
----------------------------------

If you have a kernel you do not have installed but yet want to build the
compat-wireless-2.6 drivers for it you can use this syntax:

make KLIB=/home/mcgrof/kernels/linux-2.6.23.9 KLIB_BUILD=/home/mcgrof/kernels/linux-2.6.23.9

If you have a kernel installed, which is not your currently running kernel (e.g. via
distro updates; plus its corresponding kernel-dev package), you can use this syntax:

make  KLIB=/lib/modules/2.6.30.6-53.fc11.x86_64

  and to install to your system's root path for the non-running kernel:

make  KLIB=/lib/modules/2.6.30.6-53.fc11.x86_64 KMODPATH_ARG='INSTALL_MOD_PATH=' install

Bugs
-----

If you've found a bug please report it to our linux-wireless mailing list:

linux-wireless@vger.kernel.org

Report the bug because you are working with the latest and greatest.
If your bug is compatibility-related then we should still try to fix
it within the compat.[ch] work.

Please provide the output of:

sudo grep '' /sys/module/compat/parameters/compat_*

ChangeLog
---------

Here you see the list of changes to all wireless drivers, the wireless core and mac80211.

http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/linville/wireless-testing.git;a=log;

This views all the changes on the 'everything' branch of wireless-testing.git.

License
-------

This work is a subset of the Linux kernel as such we keep the kernel's
Copyright practice. Some files have their own copyright and in those
cases the license is mentioned in the file. All additional work made
to building this package is licensed under the GPLv2.

Developers
----------

Compatibility work goes into compat/compat.[ch]. If using those files do 
not suffice additional actual code changes can go into compat/compat.diff.

If you have your own wireless-testing git tree, before running admin-update.sh
be sure to set your GIT_TREE variable. For example:

export GIT_TREE=/home/mcgrof/wireless-testing/

scripts/admin-clean.sh		- Cleans the compat-wireless-2.6 tree
scripts/admin-update.sh		- Updates compat-wireless-2.6 with your git tree
scripts/admin-refresh.sh	- Does the above two

TODO
----

* Compatibilty work for 2.6.18 --> 2.6.21
