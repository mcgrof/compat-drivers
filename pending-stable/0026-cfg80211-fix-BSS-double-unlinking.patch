Subject: [PATCH 26/31] cfg80211: fix BSS double-unlinking

When multiple interfaces are actively trying
to associate with the same BSS, they may both
find that the BSS isn't there and then try to
unlink it. This can cause errors since the
unlinking code can't currently deal with items
that have already been unlinked.

Normally this doesn't happen as most people
don't try to use multiple station interfaces
that associate at the same time too.

Fix this by using the list entry as a flag to
see if the item is still on a list.
